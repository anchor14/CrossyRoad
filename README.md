# CrossyRoad

## Python Application of the Mobile Game “Crossy Road”

A program that resembles the popular mobile game, “Crossy Road,” using Python and Processing. The game-play is controlling a character in four directions (up, down, right, left) crossing a number of roads while avoiding obstacles (moving and non-moving). The obstacles can come from two directions (left, right) and move in different velocities. We are going to randomize the size and the speed of the obstacles within a certain range. The obstacles will be visualized by Processing, taking various forms of vehicles and trees.
